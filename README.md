# La Lavandera

Corporative website built for a laundry bussiness using Middleman, a static site generator written in Ruby.

## Useful and self-descriptive commands

```ruby
rake server
rake build
rake deploy
```

## Config

To have both the web and the deploy command working, just create a ".env" file using the ".env.example" as an example and put there the real configuration parameters.
