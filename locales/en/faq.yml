    intro: Questions about our services? This is your place!

    questions:

      - question: How should I prepare my clothes for collection?
        answer:   No special way! We're here to make your life easier. Just put all the clothes in a bag and we'll take care of everything. You donâ€™t have to sort your clothes by type or colour, you can put them all in the same bag. And if you're not sure how to do it, we'll provide a bag where you can put everything.

      - question: What if my clothes are damaged?
        answer:   This is not something that usually happens, we know that each item of clothing is special. If any damage occurs during the cleaning process, we will refund the full amount, do everything possible to repair it and, if necessary, offer compensation. We will also provide you with a discount voucher for your next visit.

      - question: How long does it take you to do the laundry?
        answer:   The standard service is 48 hours, but if you need it before do not hesitate to contact us. We'll do everything we can to make sure you get your clothes on time.

      - question: How do I know how an item of clothing should be washed?
        answer:   The label is your greatest ally! Read it carefully or, if it has been removed, you can come and see us for advice.

      - question: Can you remove all the stains?
        answer:   Most of them! We love challenges! But we are also realistic, and will try and give you an accurate assessment of the result you can expect.

      - question: Don't clothes shrink in the dryer?
        answer:   No, not if the correct temperature is set! Our expert team will check each item of clothing and follow the manufactures recommendations.
